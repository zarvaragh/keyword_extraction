"1,How to check if an uploaded file is an image without mime type?,""<p>I'd like to check if an uploaded file is an image file (e.g png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp) or another file. The problem is that I'm using Uploadify to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>"
<p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from checking the file extension using PHP?</p>

"2,How can I prevent firefox from closing when I press ctrl-w,""<p>In my favorite editor (vim), I regularly use ctrl-w to execute a certain action. Now, it quite often happens to me that firefox is the active window (on windows) while I still look at vim (thinking vim is the active window) and press ctrl-w which closes firefox. This is not what I want. Is there a way to stop ctrl-w from closing firefox?</p>"

"16,PHP framework URL conventions,""<p>A lot of frameworks use URL conventions like <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> which is great, but if you need any configuration beyond that, it's up to you to write your own routes.</p>"
<p>How would you handle URLs like <code>/users/{id}/friends</code> on the backend? (to list all of a user's friends)</p>
"<p>I'm thinking that in the controller, something like this would be appropriate:</p>"
<pre><code>class User {
    function index() {
        echo 'user index';
    }
}
class Friend extends User {
    function index($user_id) {
        echo 'friend index';
    }    
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you would have the following map:</p>
<pre><code>/users              -&gt; User::index()
/users/{id}         -&gt; User::view($id)
/users/{id}/friends -&gt; Friend::index($user_id)
</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to put the Friend class inside the User class but apparently you can't do that in PHP so this is the best I could come up with. Thoughts?</p>
"<p>What URL would use for editing your list of friends? <code>/users/{id}/friends/edit</code> could work, but it doesn't seem appropriate, since you should never be editing someone else's friend list. Would <code>/account/friends/edit</code> be a better choice? Where would you put the corresponding code for that? In a friend controller, or a user controller, or a specialized account controller?</p>"
<p>Bonus question: which do you prefer? <code>/photos/delete/{id}</code> or <code>/photos/{id}/delete</code></p>
<p><hr /></p>
<p><strong>The answers:</strong></p>
"<p>So, what I've gathered from the answers is that if the """"thing"""" is complicated (like """"friends"""") but doesn't have its own controller, you can give it one without a model, or if it's not, you should stuff it in with whatever it's most closely related to. Your URLs should not influence where you put your code. Most people seem to think you should stick to <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> whever possible, because it's what people are familiar with.</p>"
"<p>No one really commented on the extended class aside from saying it's """"awkward"""". Perhaps FriendList would have been a more appropriate class in that case if I really wanted to separate it out.</p>"

<blockquote>
"  <p>Cut Poison Burn is a controversial, eye opening, and sometimes heartbreaking documentary that puts the business of cancer treatment under the microscope. Follow the frustrating journeys of critically ill cancer patients as they try to navigate the confusing and dangerous maze of treatment and encounter formidable obstacles in the “cancer industrial complex.”  A compelling critique of the influence of medical monopolies, the power of pharmaceutical companies and government agencies, Cut Poison Burn is essential viewing for anyone and everyone touched by cancer.</p>"

<blockquote>
"  <p>From 1920 to the present time, we have made little or no progress in the treatment of adult cancers. So a person who gets prostate cancer or breast cancer today will live as long as a person who got it in 1920. No big change. With all the radiation therapy that began in the 10's and 20's, combination chemotherapy in the 60's, immunotherapy that began in the 70's, PET scans, MRI scans, you name it, billions and billions and billions of research dollar that we've thrown into this whole area of cancer research and treatment... little or no significant progress in the treatment of adult cancers.</p>"

int[] filterFlags = filterStatus.toIntArray();
foreach (int flag in filterFlags) {
"   Console.WriteLine(""""{0}\n"""", flag);"

<p>It will output:</p>

8</code></pre>
"<p>As you can see, to get this done I'm doing the following:</p>"

"50,How to control error keys using ModelStateWrapper=,""<p>I’m using the a service layer with a ModelStateWrapper as shown <a href=""""http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/validating-with-a-service-layer-cs"""" rel=""""nofollow"""">here</a>.</p>"
<p>What’s he proper way to control the error keys to use when validating in the service layer so they correspond to the input names in my views?</p>
<p>e.g. I have the following ViewModel for a customer:</p>
<pre><code>public class CustomerViewModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    /*…*/
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the following ViewModel for some use case’s View (the user can create two customers on the fly in this use case by entering their names):</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeOtherUseCaseViewModel
{
    public CustomerViewModel BuyingCustomer { get; set; }
    public CustomerViewModel SellingCustomer { get; set; }
    /*… */
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which I use in the View like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;%: Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.BuyingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
&lt;%: Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.BuyingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
&lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;%: Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.SellingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
&lt;%: Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.SellingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
</code></pre>
"<p>In my customer service I’ve the following validation method which gets called when creating the customer (note that this is a different Customer class, this is a domain class):</p>"
<pre><code>public bool ValidateCustomer(Customer customer)
{
    /* Check if there is another customer with the same name */
    if (/*…*/)
    {
"        _validationDictionary.addError(“Name”, “There is another customer with the same name”); //the _validationDictionary holds the ModelStateWrapper"
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Do you see my problem?</p>
"<p>Depending on the View, the error should be added with the key <code>“BuyingCustomer.Name”</code> or <code>“SellingCustomer.Name”</code> (or eventually there will be two errors, one with each key) instead of just “Name”; otherwise the framework won’t properly highlight the fields and show the errors.</p>"
"<p><strong>What is the proper way to solve this situation neatly?</strong> I don't want to pass the """"error key prefix"""" to the service layer, because that's a UI concern and not a service layer concern, (right?).</p>"

<p>I'd like some suggestions on how to do this.</p>

<p>This would mean that my backup total is 73.5gb after 3 days of backups. Then I want to keep that third day backup for 1 week. So on the 10th day it is deleted. So about 85gb of total data is backed up.</p>
<p>Ever hour for 2 days and then 1 hour from every day after that 8 times.</p>
<p>I was thinking the easiest way to do it would be move that 1 hour backup from the third day to a new folder and have a separate script for it that is run daily. However I am not sure how I would go about picking out one of them out from the others and how to delete the ones older than 2 days. </p>
<p>I would likely run these scripts as cronjobs and set them to daily.</p>

"<p>I'm looking for a way to query if for example F is a descendant of A (note: F doesn't need to be a <strong>direct</strong> descendant of F), which, in this particular case would be true. Only a limited amount of potential parent nodes need to be tested against a larger potential descendants node pool.</p>"
"<p>UPDATE: when testing whether a node is a descendant of a node in the potential parent pool, it needs to be tested against ALL potential parent nodes.</p>"
<p>This is what a came up with:</p>
<ul>
"<li><p>Convert multiway tree to a trie, i.e. assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree:</p>"
<pre><code> A = 1
 B = 11
 C = 12
 D = 111
 E = 112
 F = 121
</code></pre></li>
"<li><p>Then, reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nodes to be tested against, i.e. if C is added to the potential parent node pool, do:</p>"

*[1]  [1]  ...
 [2] *[2]  ...
 [3]  [3]  ...
 [4]  [4]  ...
 ...  ...

"<li><p>When testing if a node is a descendant of a potential parent node, take its trie prefix, lookup the first character in the first """"prefix array"""" (see above) and if it is present, lookup the second prefix character in the second """"prefix array"""" and so on, i.e. testing F leads to:</p>"
<pre><code> F = 1    2    1

"<p>so yes F, is a descendant of C.</p></li>"
</ul>
"<p>This test seems to be worst case O(n), where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. However, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. Combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. However, memory overhead is a concern.</p>"

  <p>proc1 | proc2 &amp; proc3 | proc4 | proc5</p>
</blockquote>
"<p>Lots of other resources also discuss the relationship between process groups and pipelining. However, the one thing which I cannot find is an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this is implemented.</p>"
"<p>I know that in Linux shells like Boune-again shell (BASH), processes in a pipeline are executed in parallel -- that is, in the previous example showing <code>proc3 | proc4 | proc5</code>, all three of these processes are simultaneously executed. The stdin of proc4 is connected to the stdin of proc3. (I also know that MS-DOS used temporary files and did not execute pipes in parallel, but let's ignore that for the moment).</p>"
"<p>So, I've got proc3, proc4, proc5 all in a process group. Fantastic. How does this actually help with creating the pipelines between them?</p>"
"<p>As far as I can tell, I need to do the following to enable pipelining in a shell which I build:</p>"

"<li>Create N-1 pipelines, where N is the number of processes in the"

"<li>In each forked process, I need to use dup2 to properly set up the"

"<li>Then, after all of the forked processes have confirmation that they"
have all finalized setting up their pipes (likely via some IPC via a

"160,Black screen during setContentView execution,""<p>I have a <code>MainActivity</code>. Sometimes when it is loading I observe black screen for a second."
I measured timings for operations in <code>onCreate</code> method and discovered that more than one second was spent for <code>setContentView(R.layout.main_screen);</code>
I prefer to show previous screen (in my case Splash screen) instead of this black screen during <code>setContentView</code> execution. <strong>How can I rid off this black screen?</strong></p>
<p>Seems android in some way preloads layouts and such problems occurs sometimes. But if I kill my process and start app I always see this black screen.</p>

"<p>I am working on an application to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and a web server (see <a href=""""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3180499/how-to-intercept-and-modify-http-responses-on-server-side"""">how to intercept and modify HTTP responses on server side?</a> for the background). I decided to implement a reverse proxy in ASP.Net which forwards client requests to the back-end HTTP server, translates links and headers from the response to the properly """"proxified"""" URL, and sends the response to the client after having extracted relevant information from the response. </p>"
"<p>It is working as expected, except for the authentication part: the web server uses NTLM authentication by default, and just forwarding requests and responses through the reverse proxy does not allow the user to be authenticated on the remote application. Both the reverse proxy and the web application are on the same physical machine and are executed in the same IIS server (Windows server 2008/IIS 7 if that matters). I tried both enabling and disabling authentication on the reverse proxy app with no luck. </p>"
"<p>I have looked for information about it, and it seems to be related to the """"double-hop problem"""", which I do not understand. My question is: is there a way to authenticate the user on the remote application through the reverse proxy using NTLM?

"The reason for the constraints is that the HTML code is going into an e-mail, and it turns out that hotmail supports neither.<br>"
"I remember that when I first began studying CSS, fiddling around with float-ing text around images I often ended up with the text merrily going all over the image. Sadly, I can't reproduce that behavior.</p>"

"As usual in these cases, I'm using tables to make sure that everything stays in place AND works crossbrowser+crossmailclient.<br>"
"The problem arises from the fact that the middle """"text goes here"""" area is not a white rectangle, but has a some background graphics.<br>"

This process has been running for maybe 7 or 8 years on an ASP.NET (.NET 2.0) webform and suddenly (sometime over the last 6-18 months) it's not working the way it used to. Perhaps after .NET 4.0 was installed on the client server, or maybe after some other framework update(?) or windows update(?) or provider update(?). Our DLL has not changed in a few years. I'd like to fix this legacy process with the least amount of hacking and slashing possible.</p>"
"<p>There are three data types being exported: integer, string, and decimal. <b>The problem is that all the integer columns are being exported as decimals now.</b> The CSV export library looks at the datatypes of the columns to determine the correct output format, so I use a XSD file to define my DataSet before filling it.

"252,Custom View Scrolling issues Android,""<p>I've been designing an application that requires the use of a scrollbar on a custom view. The problem that I have run into is that my custom view's height will constantly change when new items are added by the user. I suspect that this isn't a very unusual problem, but to complicate things, I'm not actually adding new objects to my custom view, I'm just drawing Bitmap images on the canvas. The reason this is troublesome to me is when Android inflates the layout, it sets the size to be whatever I tell it (0dip) and as I add the Bitmaps, it simply changes the size to fill the Scrollview; thereby, whenever the Custom View draws an image beyond the current height constraints, instead of scrolling, the app simply cuts the picture off to maintain the current height.</p>"

"<p>I integrated a jquery plugin so that the user can use a color picker. I like it since it's very easy to use.

"297,How can I pass a property as a delegate?,""<p>This is a theoretical question, I've already got a solution to my problem that took me down a different path, but I think the question is still potentially interesting.</p>"
<p>Can I pass object properties as delegates in the same way I can with methods?  For instance:</p>
"<p>Let's say I've got a data reader loaded up with data, and each field's value needs to be passed into properties of differing types having been checked for DBNull.  If attempting to get a single field, I might write something like:</p>"
"<pre><code>if(!rdr[""""field1""""].Equals(DBNull.Value)) myClass.Property1 = rdr[""""field1""""];"
</code></pre>
"<p>But if I've got say 100 fields, that becomes unwieldy very quickly.  There's a couple of ways that a call to do this might look nice:</p>"
"<pre><code>myClass.Property = GetDefaultOrValue&lt;string&gt;(rdr[""""field1""""]); //Which incidentally is the route I took"
</code></pre>
<p>Which might also look nice as an extension method:</p>
"<pre><code>myClass.Property = rdr[""""field1""""].GetDefaultOrValue&lt;string&gt;();"
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
"<pre><code>SetPropertyFromDbValue&lt;string&gt;(myClass.Property1, rdr[""""field1""""]); //Which is the one that I'm interested in on this theoretical level"
</code></pre>
"<p>In the second instance, the property would need to be passed as a delegate in order to set it.</p>"
<p>So the question is in two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this possible?</li>
<li>What would that look like?</li>

"<p>Often, the service would not stop when I try to stop it from the Windows service management console.

"<p>Firstly, I don't understand how that number could ever be greater than 10, despite the <code>ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads</code> should limit it to 10?</p>"
"<p>Secondly, even if I did not set the maximum number of threads, I would expect the finally block of the PollWrapper's to eventually bring the count back to 0. If the counter stays greater than 0, it can be explained only with the finally block not executing, right!? How that is possible?</p>"

"328,Virtualized Development Environments in Enterprise Networks,""<p>We are attempting to implement a development environment using virtualization for a small team of 4 developers within an enterprise organization.  This would allow us to set up separate development, testing, and staging environments - as well as allowing access to new operating systems that are requirements for systems or tools we are evaluating.   We re-purposed an existing workstation-class machine, threw in 24GB RAM and RAID-10, and were doing fine until we attempted to get the machine added to the domain.  </p>"
"<p>Now we are beginning the war that all enterprise developers since the beginning of time have had to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment.  The network and IT admins' have raised concerns ranging from """"ESX Server is the enterprise standard"""" to """"servers are not allowed on client VLANs"""" to """"[fill-in-the-blank] is not a skill set currently possessed in the local or enterprise IT organization"""".</p>"
"<p>We could justify production-class hardware and formal IT support if we had to, but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache.  Even then it might take months to formally get IT resources assigned by treating this as a production system - and even if we did, we would likely lose the local control we need.</p>"
<p>I imagine that many of you have had similar struggles over developer control of non-production environments - and virtualization in particular - so my questions are as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>What strategies and arguments have helped you win over the infrastructure (IT &amp; Network) folks to allow these types of silos to exist within enterprises which have standard network and security policies in place that would generally (and understandably) preclude this type of non-(centrally)-managed infrastructure?</li>
<li>Have you found this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership?</li>
"<li>If you ended up with a IT-managed development environment, how much of a roadblock has it been for day-to-day development and testing?</li>"
<li>Has anyone ended up moving their development environment to a disconnected VLAN or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggles?</li>
</ol>
"<p>Also, this is not a Hyper-V vs. ESX holy war (we would be fine with either - but Hyper-V was selected since it is """"free"""" with MSDN for these purposes [yes, VMWare has free tools too - but the good management tools generally aren't], and would be easier to manage by the local developers in a """"Microsoft Shop"""") - so arguments for or against either are outside the scope of this question.</p>"
<p>This is also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - I suppose the same question could be asked without the virtualization component to the equation.</p>
"<p>Also assume that the dev team has already made assurances to either manage patch management and antivirus, or integrate with the existing enterprise systems if they will support it."
"This scenario, with different questions, is also <a href=""""http://serverfault.com/questions/316200/enterprise-network-it-admins-what-is-required-for-developers-to-run-their-own-vm"""">posted on SF</a> to hopefully elicit the opposing viewpoint.</p>"

"347,Why does calling ob_flush() slow down my latency so much?,""<p>I am writing an application in PHP, and I decided to do some testing on my own to determine how well PHP handles buffers and buffering. Specifically, I wanted to see if manually calling <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> would have a huge effect on my program.</p>"
"<p>I conjured up 10KB of lorem ipsum and went to work. I put a timer in PHP at the start and end of a for loop that writes the 10KB of lipsum (in display:none div blocks) 100 times, for a total of 1MB of data, which I figured would be enough work that random CPU load wouldn't throw off my data too much.</p>"
"<p>Besides the PHP timer, I popped open Chrome's developer tools (F12) and recorded the """"time"""" and """"latency"""" field. If I have my terminology correct, the """"time"""" is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and """"latency"""" is just the time until the page first received data from the server.</p>"
"<p>So here's the mystery: When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages are:</p>"
<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00630ms
Chrome Time: 565.6ms
Chrome Latency: 28.3ms
</code></pre>
"<p>When I call <code>ob_start()</code> at the very beginning, and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the very end:</p>"
<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00792ms
Chrome Time: 540ms
Chrome Latency: 33ms
</code></pre>
"<p>HOWEVER, and here's the mystery - <strong>when I call <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chrome-reported latency spikes by 4x.</strong></p>"
<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.005814ms
Chrome Time: 624.7ms
Chrome Latency: 134.9ms ???
</code></pre>
"<p>As far as I know, the chrome latency should be <strong>cut</strong> by 100x, since I'm flushing the buffer 1/100 of the way through the PHP output. I know that the <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> operate on a higher buffer, and they actually flush into a lower buffer, I would expect that lower buffer to flush at the same intervals, meaning I would see about the same latency.</p>"
"<p>My test rig is a very modest Intel ATOM netbook with Nvidia ION graphics, Windows 7 home premium (32-bit) and WAMPserver running Apache 2.2.22 with pretty much default settings.

"366,Ubuntu: How to I add string to terminal window title from command line?,""<p>I am working on a Ubuntu VM where i have multiple terminal windows open at the same time. I switch between them many times and it's hard to keep track of which window has which purpose. So what I want to do is to issue some sort of command from the command line that would permanently alter the title of the window. One approach is to modify the following line in <code>.bashrc</code> to, say, add the word <code>FOO</code> to the title:</p>"
"<pre><code>PS1=""""\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@${InstName}:FOO:\w\a\]$PS1"""""
</code></pre>
"<p>Then I would do <code>source .bashrc</code>. The problem is that I only have one <code>.bashrc</code> and many windows. So if I open two windows one after another without changing the line in <code>.bashrc</code>, I'll have <code>FOO</code> in both of them. So I want to issue a command from each window instead. How do I do that? </p>"
"<p>NOTE: The stuff around <code>FOO</code> in the <code>PS1</code> line above is important too, so what I want is to essentially add a window-specific string to the generic <code>PS1</code> specification above.</p>"

"<p>I'm trying to allow a user to view all of their outstanding submissions in one place. So, for each user, I'm trying to query the db to get all <strong>submissions</strong> belonging to <strong>articles</strong> that belong to that user, but only returning the submissions for which response is NULL (meaning there is no response yet, and thus the submission is still outstanding).</p>"

<p>IDEAL FUNCTIONING:</p>
"<p>I would like to be able to type a few words into the search box and have the query look for each search word across all three fields.  Additionally I would like results with more matching words to be ranked (weighted) higher.  (e.g. a search with words """"dog sled 2005"""" would give a higher rank to a query that found all three words somewhere across the three fields and give less weight to a query that found only two or one of the words.)"
"Finally, since my database is growing I would like to truncate the results so only 50 results are displayed for any search.</p>"
<p>Thanks in advance.  --Tim</p>
<p>UPDATE: I've addressed some early questions I got on this issue below...</p>
"<p><strong>1) What are some examples of real-world data that can be found in [field1, field2, field3]? Would it be individual words or entire phrases/sentences/paragraphs?</strong></p>"
"<p>The real world data is about 15 fields including numbers, words, phrases, abbreviations, lists of words, and even paragraphs. They are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents.  Some fields and examples follow:</p>"
<p>Year (e.g. 2010)</p>
<p>Season (e.g. fall)</p>
<p>First_name (e.g. William)</p>
"<p>Last_Name (e.g. McShane)  note: would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e.g. O'reilly, can't, Smith-Jenkins.</p>"
<p>Title (e.g. The economic decline of blah blah regions)</p>
<p>Description (e.g. this text addresses a wide range of issues on ... )</p>
<p>Classification (e.g. 4AB51-45)</p>
<p>Phone (e.g. 555-121-5444)</p>
<p>Email (e.g. jkr@ppp.com</p>
<p>etc... </p>
"<p><strong>2. In the design you're looking for, does keyword order still matter? For instance, if field1 = """"I ate a souffle made from lobster"""", and I search for """"lobster souffle"""", should it work?</strong></p>"
"<p>I'm not so concerned with word order or even phrases.  There will likely never be more than 20,000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results.  With one key word though it is impossible.  there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can't even search by year without getting a flood of results.  The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords.  Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields.  so i might type (2010 economic airlines Florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e.g. a Florida based airline, etc.</p>"
"<p>Sorry for the long winded response.  So, to answer the original question... If you search for """"lobster Souffle"""" is should find a record with a Field1 entry of (I ate a souffle made from lobster).  Similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words.</p>"
<p><strong>And now two design questions:</strong></p>
"<p><strong>3. Will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? The reason I'm asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate 'search' table or something like that. It's not 'normalised' (if you're not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. I can explain that a little more later if you want.</strong></p>"
<p>I will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future.  I don't know what normalization is.</p>
"<p><strong>4. I see you're stripping out all characters that aren't alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like """"wasn't"""" or """"O'Ryan""""), hyphens, and so forth?</strong></p>"
"<p>As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens.  I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from.  I don't think any search phrases will include words like """"isn't"""" but might include authors with appostrophes like O'reilly or hyphens like Smith-Galviston.  And there will be middle initials too like """"George P. Scott""""</p>"

However, I'm trying to make use of the <code>packagesToScan</code> property instead. Below is the full startup log and the error produced after making one request to the servlet which ultimately attempts to create a new user in the database. It doesn't seem to recognise that the <code>User</code> object is an Entity. Since I have little experience with Spring, I was wondering if anyone, firstly can spot a mistake I'm making, but otherwise, knows the best way to debug this. I want to know what Entity objects have been recognised by the EntityManagerFactory.</p>"
<p>My backup option is to switch to using persistence.xml (haven't tried it yet actually) but I'd like to be rid of that if possible (one less XML file to worry about).</p>
"<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've updated the error log after making the recommended config change to the entityManagerFactory, based on the answer by Sean Patrick Floyd but that did not solve the main issue. What I have also done is tried an alternative way of getting this to work by creating a persistence.xml file (the old and more common way of doing this) and added a small piece of test code within the servlet I access to kick off this functionality."
So now I have this bit of code in my servlet:</p>
<pre><code>User user = new User();
"user.setFirstName(""""John"""");"
"user.setLastName(""""Doe"""");"
// user = userService.addUser(user);
"EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(""""proxiPU"""");"
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
em.getTransaction().begin();
em.persist(user); 
em.getTransaction().commit();
em.close();
emf.close();
</code></pre>
<p>And this persistence.xml file:</p>
"<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""""1.0"""" encoding=""""UTF-8"""" ?&gt;"
"&lt;persistence xmlns:xsi=""""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"""""

        &lt;exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;false&lt;/exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;
        &lt;properties&gt;

&lt;/persistence&gt;

<p>This actually works so I'm wondering now whether it's a problem with the way the EntityManagerFactory is initialised or something like that. I've included the code for the UserService class that is supposed to do the database related stuff. </p>

"384,How may a linked list be saved/loaded from a file efficiently using Objective-C?,""<p>After four weeks of learning Objective-C for the iPhone, my first useful application is almost finished. However, I still need to save several instance variables whenever the current view is changed and to reload them when the view is reopened.</p>"
"<p>I have no trouble loading variables with basic C types like <em>int</em> and <em>BOOL</em>, but am having difficulty with a linked list made of Objective-C objects.</p>"

"Each element consists of a <em>last</em> pointer, a <em>next</em> pointer, a pointer to a nested linked list (<em>nestedPtr</em>), and some variables.</p>"
<p>My first attempt was to do the following in the loading code:</p>
<pre><code>//dataStorageObj will contain the values to be loaded
dataStorageObj = [[DataSaver alloc] init];
"NSData *data =[[NSMutableData alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""""Archive""""]];"

"<li>Is there a more efficient way to maintain the relationship between <em>currPointer</em>, <em>endPointer</em>, and <em>startPointer</em> than by searching through the list using the <em>lastElement</em> and <em>firstElement</em> methods?</li>"
"<li>Is there something wrong with the techniques behind the loading code I have presented? Without it, I have no problems; with it, I still get *BAD_ACCESS* messages.

I want to be able to update multiple columns of multiple rows at a time, but not necessarily to update every column of every row.</p>"
<p>Here is an example command I would like to be able to execute:</p>
<pre><code>UPDATE person

"END,"
sex = CASE id

"WHERE id IN (1,2,3)"

"<p>However this returns an error, telling me column 'name' cannot be null.  So it seem to me that specifying <code>WHERE id IN (x,y,z)</code> means all selected columns must be updated, even though we're indicating which values to place on a case by case basis.</p>"
"<p>Is there any way around this limitation, like a special notation to indicate """"keep the original value""""?  If not, is there some other way to update select, arbitrary columns of multiple rows in one query?</p>"

<p>Now the servers (for instance 172.21.37.14) could ping the outside world again.  Mail started flowing (Domain POP was successful) etc. etc.  But I forgot to check if webmail worked from the outside admittedly.  </p>
<p>But the webservers at  172.21.37.17 and 172.21.37.24 still didn't respond from the outside world.  Although I was able to PPTP VPN in on 10.10.39.10 (interface) which is the outside interface IP address. and it is static mapped to 172.21.37.20.</p>
<p>So I'm thinking there must be something wrong with NAT somewhere? no response from 10.10.39.11 to 10.10.39.14.. </p>
<p>Could anyone look over the config and please let me know what I've done wrong?   Is there something I've missed?  well obviously but.. please help!  Thank you.</p>

"393,CSS3 Transforms: Multiple Origins?,""<p>Is it possible to specify an origin at the top left (0%, 0%) for scaling, and a different origin (center) for rotation in CSS3?  I am only working with webkit, if that helps.</p>"
<p>I am currently using a transform list (i.e. -webkit-transform: scale(newScale) rotate(newRotate)</p>
"<p>but it seems like it isn't possible to change the origin in-between passes.  Is there a better way to look at this?  Presently, if I scale an object and rotate it with an origin at the default center, the position of the element is now off and so when you drag the element, the cursor is still at the top left of the element, whereas it should be at the center. Changing the origin to the center to scale it fixes this, but presents new problems with rotation and flipping.</p>"

I don't know where I first heard the anecdote, I'm pretty sure it was oral, so I had to dig a bit to find notable claims. The anecdote goes something like this: a muslim emissary arrived at the czar to talk about islam. He talked about the religion, the rites, the position of women, etc. etc., and the czar sounded quite interested. He almost succeeded in convincing the czar, when he mentioned the ban on the consumption of alcohol. Then, the czar pointed out, islam could not be an option in Russia.</p>"

  <p>Legend holds that the tenth-century Russian prince Vladimir the Great rejected Islam as a state religion for the country because of its prohibition of alcohol.</p>

"  <p>The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. The emissaries visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews and the Muslims, they finally arrived in Constantinople. <strong>They rejected Islam because</strong>, among other things, <strong>it prohibited the consumption of alcohol</strong>, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But, at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there, that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow.</p>"

"407,Is binding objects to angular's $rootScope in a service bad?,""<p>In angular, I have an object that will be exposed across my application via a service.</p>"
"<p>Some of the fields on that object are dynamic, and will be updated as normal by bindings in the controllers that use the service. But some of the fields are computed properties, that depend on the other fields, and need to be dynamically updated.</p>"
"<p>Here's a simple example (which is working on jsbin here: <a href=""""http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit"""">http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit</a>). My service model exposes fields <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> where <code>c</code> is calculated from <code>a + B</code> in <code>calcC()</code>. Note, in my real application the calculations are a lot more complex, but the essence is here.</p>"
"<p>The only way I can think to get this to work, is to bind my service model to the $rootScope, and then use $rootScope.$watch to watch for any of the controllers changing <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> and when they do, recalculating <code>c</code>. But that seems ugly. <strong>Is there a better way of doing this?</strong></p>"
<hr>
"<p>A second concern is performance. In my full application <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are big lists of objects, which get aggregated down to <code>c</code>. This means that the $rootScope.$watch functions will be doing a lot of deep array checking, which sounds like it will hurt performance.</p>"
"<p>I have this all working with an evented approach in BackBone, which cuts down the recalculation as much as possible, but angular doesn't seem to play well with an evented approach. <strong>Any thoughts on that would be great too.</strong></p>"

"<p>So there is CoffeeScript, which I'm looking at with a fair amount of interest. Then there is RJS, but then Rails 3 has pulled support for that and I don't want to learn an outdated method. Then there is Go, which I'm not sure has enough support yet and just don't know enough about yet. Then of course all along here most of the time here there's jquery.</p>"
"<p>But should I even use jquery? Can I get around writing javascript entirely? Would/could the circumvention attempt be fruitful? I'm not asking for a therapy session or a bashing session, so if you're wound up like that please don't post here. I'm actually intrigued by javascript. If only because all of the """"cool"""" programmers are talking about functional languages now.</p>"
"<p>But I don't want to waste my time. And all I really need to have is a robust way for passing information from rails/active-record to the javascript in a variety of ways.

I need to be able to look at javascript, or coffeescript, or go, or whatever, and see it like I see ruby, which looks like an orchestra if it's written right.</p>"
<p>So my questions are these:
"a.) It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who don't know what exactly it is they are doing. What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code, thinking aloud (CORRECTLY) about Javascript? Also rails+javascript materials. Sorely lacking. There is not a single book out on Rails 3 + Javascript, which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006's """"Ajax on Rails"""". What resources do you know of other than """"lots of time""""? "
"b.) RJS, Coffeescript, etc v. Javascript + Jquery (or alt.)"
"What are the weaknesses of using the 'higher-level' abstracted languages and what are the benefits. And most importantly for me, a rails user, <strong>what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now??</strong> RJS sounded like a great idea. But it used prototype right? Is there an """"RJS"""" which is Rails 3 ready?</p>"
"<p>** And, again, guys, the book issue. Seriously this is a nice little opportunity for a knowledgable rails/javascript developer. Nothing has been released by the major publishers explicitly on Rails and Javascript since 2006!!! That is just astonishing.</p>"
